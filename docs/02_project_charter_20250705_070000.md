# Project Charter: Custom LLM Development Initiative

**Document ID**: 02_project_charter_20250705_070000  
**Created**: July 5, 2025 07:00:00 UTC  
**Project Code**: NEXUS-LLM-001  
**Classification**: Internal Development

## Project Overview

### Mission Statement
Develop a production-ready, enterprise-grade large language model using exclusively open-source technologies, achieving performance parity with commercial LLMs while maintaining complete operational control and cost efficiency.

### Project Objectives
1. **Performance**: Match GPT-3.5/GPT-4 benchmark scores (>85 GLUE, <15 perplexity)
2. **Cost**: Achieve 90% cost reduction vs commercial API usage
3. **Independence**: Eliminate dependency on external AI service providers
4. **Customization**: Enable domain-specific fine-tuning capabilities
5. **Scalability**: Support enterprise-level deployment and usage

### Success Criteria
- Model achieves target benchmark performance
- Production deployment handles 1000+ concurrent requests
- Total project cost remains under $1,000
- Operational costs under $500/month at scale
- Complete technical documentation and runbooks delivered

## Stakeholders

### Project Sponsor
- **Role**: Executive Leadership
- **Responsibilities**: Strategic direction, resource allocation, go/no-go decisions

### Technical Lead
- **Role**: Architecture and Implementation
- **Responsibilities**: Technical decisions, code quality, system design

### DevOps Engineer
- **Role**: Infrastructure and Deployment
- **Responsibilities**: AWS infrastructure, CI/CD, monitoring

### Data Engineer
- **Role**: Data Pipeline Management

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **GPU Resource Availability**: Mitigation via AWS Spot instances and reserved capacity
- **Model Performance**: Mitigation through systematic benchmarking and iterative improvement

### Medium Risk
- **Data Quality Issues**: Mitigation via automated quality checks and validation
- **Cost Overruns**: Mitigation through continuous cost monitoring and optimization

### Low Risk
- **Technical Complexity**: Well-established open-source tools and frameworks
- **Timeline Delays**: Buffer time built into schedule

## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- 1 Technical Lead (full-time, 8 weeks)
- 1 DevOps Engineer (part-time, 4 weeks)
- 1 Data Engineer (part-time, 2 weeks)

### Technical Resources
